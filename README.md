# Introduction
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing crop yield based on various factors such as soil texture, pH levels, soil depth, and annual rainfall. The dashboard helps users such as farmers, agronomists, and researchers make informed decisions to improve crop production by understanding how soil conditions and rainfall impact yield.

The analysis focuses on various crops including wheat, maize, sorghum, and teff, offering valuable data-driven insights for agricultural planning.

Interactive Filters: Users can filter by crop type, year, soil type, and variety to explore specific trends.
# Technologies Used
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
Excel/CSV: The main data source for crop yield, soil characteristics, and rainfall statistics.
Python (optional): Used for data cleaning and pre-processing.
Data Overview

# The dataset contains:

Crop Yield Data: Yield information for crops like wheat, maize, sorghum, and teff over multiple years.
Soil Information: Data on soil texture, pH, and depth as well as nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).
Rainfall Data: Annual rainfall records across different regions and years.

# Key Insights
Wheat Dominates Yield: Wheat has the highest grain yield, followed by maize, with specific soil types like clay and loam contributing to higher yields.


Rainfall's Impact: A clear positive correlation between higher rainfall and increased crop yield for most crops. However, crops like sorghum show relatively stable yields despite rainfall variations.

Soil Composition Importance: Crops grown on soils like pellic vertisols consistently produce higher yields, highlighting the critical role of soil type in agricultural productivity.

Nutrient Requirements: Nitrogen (N) is the most widely used nutrient across all crops, followed by phosphorus (P), with significant variations in nutrient usage between crop types.
